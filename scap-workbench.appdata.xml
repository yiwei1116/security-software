    <name>SCAP Workbench</name>
    <summary>A GUI tool that serves as an SCAP scanner and provides tailoring functionality for SCAP content</summary>
    <description>
        <p>
            The main goal of this application is to lower the initial barrier of using SCAP.
            Therefore, the scope of very narrow - SCAP Workbench only scans a single machine and only with XCCDF/SDS (no direct OVAL evaluation).
            The assumption is that this is enough for users who want to scan a few machines and users with huge amount of machines to scan will just use scap-workbench to test or hand-tune their content before deploying it with more advanced (and harder to use) tools like spacewalk.
        </p>
